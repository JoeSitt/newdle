Re-implementation of backend: 10 hours
Previous event storage did not provide ability to support 
non-contiguous sessions over multiple days, so this was 
re implemented.

Re-implementation of storage mechanism: 3 hours
XML storage was specific to the implementation of the Event class.
Data serialization library was used so that backend implementation
could change without a need to update saving mechanism.
