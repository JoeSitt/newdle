Re-implementation of backend: 10 hours
- Previous event storage did not provide ability to support 
  non-contiguous sessions over multiple days, so this was 
  re implemented.

Re-implementation of storage mechanism: 5 hours
- XML storage was specific to the implementation of the Event class.
- Data serialization library was used so that backend implementation
  could change without a need to update saving mechanism.

Implementation of Task features: 16 hours
- The creator of an event should be able able to add a task list to an event (e.g. bring soda, bring salad, OR prepare slides, contact so-and-so)
- All event attendees should be able to sign up for zero or more tasks
- Event attendees should still be able to list all times they are available, and now can sign up to handle tasks
- An attendee can sign up for multiple tasks
- Multiple attendees cannot sign up for the same task
